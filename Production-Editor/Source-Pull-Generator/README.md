3. Click upload to insert in the author's original Word document (make sure that document has all of the citations in footnotes and that there are no endnotes in the document).
1. If you want to get the links to Cases / Articles from Westlaw already populated into the final product select the checkbox `Get Westlaw Links` and insert your login details.
1. Then click `Generate Excel` to generate the Excel file based on the word document that you selected.
- Note: while there is a loading screen that pops up, it should only take less than 10 seconds for the program to run if it is not trying to go to Westlaw. However, if the program is going to Westlaw, it will take much longer depending on the number of cases that have to be found (approximately 30 seconds per case / article).
1. Once the program is finished there will be a popup to let you know that it is finished, the output will have been downloaded to your `Downloads` folder. Clicking `Ok` on the popup will take you back to Step 3 if you would like to upload a different document to generate its Source Pull Excel file.
